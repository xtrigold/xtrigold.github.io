I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/departments/computer-science/) at the [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/). I am a member of [Multimodal Vision Research Laboratory (MVRL)](http://mvrl.cs.uky.edu/) supervised by [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/) and a member of [Lin Brain Lab](https://linbrain.com/) supervised by [Dr. Ai-Ling Lin](https://linbrain.com/about/). My research focuses on machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, specifically multi-modality learning and medical image analysis.

I obtained my Bachelor degree from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/), China in June 2011 and Master degree from [Stuttgart University](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/), Germany in May 2016. In 2008-2009, I attended [Xi'An Jiaotong University](https://edu.liuhua.org.my/en/university/china/xian-jiaotong-university) as exchange student.

I love my wife, my baby girl, and my cat.
