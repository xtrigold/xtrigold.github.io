I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/departments/computer-science/) at the [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/), workingunder the supervision of [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/). 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering from [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/), China in June 2017.

I love climbing, hiking, and music.
